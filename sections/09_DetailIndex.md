# Detail Index  

* It is not always the most helpful to print a table of information about a piece if we cannot see where they appear in the music itself. To bridge this gap between the code and the music, we can display DataFrames relative to measures and beats within those measures, rather than relative to their beat placement in the piece as a whole. This can be done with the help of the `detailIndex()` function. The `detailIndex` functions can be applied to DataFrames including outputs from the `notes()` function, the `melodic()` function, the `harmonic()` function, and the `ngrams()` function.
