# OMAC ontology
The repository contains an OWL ontology, called OMAC - Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music, for musical critical assessments.

Current research work aims at improving and testing OMAC against domain experts' knowledge and case studies. The data included in the owl files of the ontologies are meant for testing purposes only. You can browse the Data folder on this repository for some examples.
