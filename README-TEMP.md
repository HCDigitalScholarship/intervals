## About CRIM Intervals

Based on **Python** and **Pandas**, and Mike Cuthbert's excellent **music21** (https://web.mit.edu/music21/), **CRIM Intervals** is a pattern finding engine for musical scores, with an emphasis on the kinds of melodic and harmonic patterns found in Renaissance polyphony. It has been developed as a primary data analysis tool for **Citations:  The Renaissance Imitation Mass** (http://crimproject.org and https://sites.google.com/haverford.edu/crim-project/home), but can be applied and adapted to a wide range of styles.

Results are reported in **Pandas** dataframes (and thus exportable in a variey of standard formats for further analysis), and also via several visualizations methods.

Some methods in **CRIM Intervals** also work with **CRIM Project** data created by human observers.

## Getting Started with CRIM Intervals

CRIM intervals is now available in a series of interactive **Jupyter** notebooks:  [https://github.com/RichardFreedman/CRIM_Public_Notebooks](https://github.com/RichardFreedman/CRIM_JHUB).  These can in turn be downloaded and adapted for your own use.
